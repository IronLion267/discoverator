Automating open source research and discovery

This is a side project that I am developing to meet three goals: 
 1. Develop tool that aids in the information gathering and reconnaissance phase of penetration testing
 2. Develop presence on Github
 3. Improve personal Python skills

Currently, the application has the ability to find certain keywords from a number of websites identified by the user.
